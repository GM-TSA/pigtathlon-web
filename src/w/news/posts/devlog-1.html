<h2>New Pig Model</h2>
<img width="80%" src="/static/news/devlog-1/newPig.jpeg" alt="New pig model"/>
<p>We felt that our old pig models weren't working for us and didn't fit the shape we needed them to be to work in some of our minigames and after a few iterations, we decided to choose our rubbery, standing pig model.</p>

<h2>New Animal Enemy Models</h2>
<p>Previously, we only had pigs in the game. So, in order to create some enemy characters, we added some new animal models.
These models are likely to change in the future but here are the first iterations:</p>

<h2>Procedural Level Generation</h2>

<p>We felt the need to make the game more replayable since now we're going for a full release instead of just a single playthrough by judges. So, we implemented a system where levels could be procedurally generated for our Cross Country minigame.</p>
